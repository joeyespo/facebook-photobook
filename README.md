Photobook
---------

A tool that allows you to download your photos from Facebook. This includes any
photos you've been tagged in and optionally the albums they're contained in.

Note: This was built to work with a currently outdated version of Facebook,
so this project no longer works. I'm publishing this project for educational
purposes only. If you fork and fix, I'll happily pull in your changes.


Dependencies
------------

A [Facebook](http://facebook.com) account and some photos.
