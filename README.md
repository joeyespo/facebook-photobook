Photobook
---------

A tool that allows you to download your photos from Facebook. This includes any
photos you've been tagged in and optionally the albums they're contained in.

Note: This was built to work with a currently outdated version of Facebook,
so this project no longer works. I'm publishing this project for educational
purposes only. If you fork and fix, I'll happily pull in your changes.
