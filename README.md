Photobook
---------

A tool that allows you to download your photos from Facebook. This includes any
photos you've been tagged in and optionally the albums they're contained in.

Note: this was built to work with a now-outdated version of Facebook, so this project no longer works.
But I'm still publishing the project for educational purposes. I do not plan on updating it any time soon.
However, **if enough people watch this repository, I'll re-implement the project to get it working again.**
And of course, if you fork and fix, I'll happily pull in your changes.


Dependencies
------------

A [Facebook](http://facebook.com) account and some photos.
